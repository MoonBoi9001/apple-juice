## 💚 Longevity Mode

<div align="center">

**The best way to preserve your Mac's battery health.**

</div>

<br>

```bash
brew install MoonBoi9001/tap/apple-juice
sudo apple-juice visudo
apple-juice maintain longevity
```

<br>

Three commands. Set it and forget it. Configure [macOS settings](#-setup) for notifications.

<br>

<div align="center">

| What it does | Why it matters |
|:---|:---|
| Maintains charge between **70-75%** | Balances lithium-ion longevity with a useful day's charge |
| Runs on wall power when plugged in | Battery sits idle at low voltage, minimal degradation |
| **Cell imbalance monitoring** | Shows per-cell voltages and imbalance in `status` |
| **BMS balancing** | Charges to 100% and holds for equalization when cells drift |

</div>

<br>

> Lithium-ion cells degrade faster at higher voltages. At 100% charge each cell sits at ~4.2V, accelerating chemical wear. At 70-75% the resting voltage drops to ~4.0V/cell, significantly reducing stress while leaving enough charge for a day of unplugged work. Once the battery reaches 75%, charging is disabled. The laptop then runs entirely from wall power — no current flows through the battery at all. Charging re-enables if the battery drops below 70%.

<br>

## ⚡ Quick Start

**Homebrew (Apple Silicon only):**

```bash
brew install MoonBoi9001/tap/apple-juice
sudo apple-juice visudo
```

**Then run:**

```bash
apple-juice maintain longevity    # recommended
```

Or pick your own level:

```bash
apple-juice maintain 80           # maintain 75-80%
apple-juice maintain 80 50        # maintain 50-80%
```

## 🔒 Security

The v2.0 rewrite eliminates entire classes of vulnerabilities present in the original bash implementation:

- No shell interpolation — native Swift binary, no bash/sed/awk attack surface
- Atomic file writes for all config and PID files
- Signal handler serialization via GCD (no re-entrancy)
- Input validation on all user-facing commands
- Process verification on PID files (confirms apple-juice owns the process)

SMC access is granted through visudo with specific command allowlists — only the exact `smc` key/value pairs needed for charging control are permitted.

<br>

---

<br>

## 🔧 How It Works

apple-juice runs as a background daemon managed by macOS `launchd`. It reads battery state through IOKit and controls charging via SMC keys using the bundled `smc` binary.

When the battery reaches the upper limit (65% in longevity mode), charging is disabled via SMC. The laptop continues to run entirely from wall power — the battery sits idle at its resting voltage with no current flowing. Charging only re-enables when the battery drops below the lower limit (60%), which only happens if you unplug.

The daemon is configured as a LaunchAgent with `KeepAlive`, so macOS automatically restarts it if the process dies unexpectedly. On clean shutdown (`maintain stop`), it re-enables charging and stays stopped. A startup recovery check runs before every command: if charging is found disabled but the daemon is not running, charging is re-enabled automatically. This ensures a Mac is never left in a non-charging state.

**Architecture:**

- Native Swift binary (no bash, no Python, no runtime dependencies)
- IOKit for direct battery reads (no `ioreg` subprocess overhead)
- IOKit power notifications for sleep/wake handling (no sleepwatcher dependency)
- `IOPMAssertionCreateWithName` for sleep prevention (no caffeinate)
- File-per-key config storage with atomic writes
- Serial dispatch queue for thread-safe SMC access

## 🗑️ Uninstalling

Always use `apple-juice uninstall` rather than `brew uninstall` directly. The uninstall command re-enables charging, stops the LaunchAgent, and cleans up all configuration files.

```bash
apple-juice uninstall
brew uninstall apple-juice    # optional, removes the binary
```

Running `brew uninstall` alone will remove the binary but leave the LaunchAgent plist and configuration in place.
